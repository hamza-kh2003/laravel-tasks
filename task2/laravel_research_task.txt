1) Laravel Folder Structure

app/
- Contains the core application logic
- Includes models, controllers, middleware, and other backend code

routes/
- Defines all application routes (URLs)
- Connects URLs to controllers

resources/
- Contains Blade view files and frontend assets
- Used for user interface and presentation

public/
- Publicly accessible folder
- Entry point of the application (index.php)
- Holds compiled CSS, JS, and images

config/
- Contains configuration files
- Manages settings like database, mail, and cache

database/
- Contains migrations, seeders, and factories
- Manages database structure and sample data


MVC Location in Laravel
- Model: app/Models
- View: resources/views
- Controller: app/Http/Controllers


--------------------------------------------------


2) Artisan CLI Basics

What is Artisan?
- Artisan is Laravel’s command-line interface (CLI)

What is it used for?
- Automates common development tasks
- Helps generate files, manage databases, and maintain the application

Three Artisan Commands

php artisan serve
- Starts a local development server

php artisan make:controller UserController
- Creates a new controller file

php artisan migrate
- Runs database migrations to update tables


--------------------------------------------------


3) Understanding the MVC Pattern

What is MVC?
- MVC stands for Model, View, Controller
- It is a design pattern that separates responsibilities

Roles

Model
- Handles data and database logic

View
- Displays data to the user

Controller
- Handles requests and connects models with views

Request Flow

Request → Route → Controller → View → Response

Explanation:
- The user sends a request
- The route determines which controller to use
- The controller processes logic and data
- The view displays the result
- The response is sent back to the browser


--------------------------------------------------


4) Routes (Understanding Only)

Where routes are defined
- routes/web.php for web pages
- routes/api.php for APIs

What a route does
- Listens for a URL
- Directs the request to a controller method

Example Route
Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);

Explanation
- URL handled: /users
- Controller: UserController
- Method: index


--------------------------------------------------


5) Blade Basics (Syntax & Structure)

What is Blade?
- Blade is Laravel’s template engine

Blade Files
- Use the .blade.php extension
- Stored in resources/views

Displaying Data
- {{ }} is used to display variables safely

How data is shown
- Controller sends data
- Blade view receives it
- Data is displayed using {{ }}


--------------------------------------------------


6) Blade Layouts (Understanding Concept)

What is a Master Layout?
- A main template that contains common page structure

Why We Use Blade Layout Directives

@extends
- Connects a view to a master layout

@section
- Defines content for a specific section

@yield
- Placeholder in the master layout

@include
- Inserts reusable view parts like header or footer

How layouts help
- Avoid repeating code
- Organize views
- Make maintenance easier


--------------------------------------------------


7) Blade Conditionals & Loops (Basic Idea)

Conditionals (@if)
- Used to display content based on a condition
- Example use: show content only if a user is logged in

Loops (@foreach)
- Used to display repeated data
- Example use: loop through a list of users

Why They Are Used
- Conditionals control when content appears
- Loops handle displaying multiple items dynamically
